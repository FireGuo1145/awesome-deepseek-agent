# Integrate DeepSeek with Veloce Lab

Veloce Lab is a personal-assistant harness built with the YumeriJS framework. It provides a Web administration console for configuring the model channels used by the assistant.

- **GitHub:** <https://github.com/veloce-ailab/veloce-lab>

#### 1. Install and start Veloce Lab

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 LTS or newer.
- In an empty project directory, download the Veloce configuration:

```powershell
irm -OutFile yumeri.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veloce-ailab/veloce-lab/main/scripts/yumeri.json
```

- Start the service. `npx` is recommended because it does not require Yumeri to be installed beforehand:

```sh
npx yumeri@latest -c yumeri.json --auto-install
```

The `--auto-install` option installs the dependencies declared by the configuration. After Veloce Lab starts, open its Web administration console and sign in with an administrator account.

#### 2. Add a DeepSeek upstream channel

1. Open **Channels** in the administration console and choose **Add upstream**.
2. Fill in the channel form:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | A label such as `DeepSeek` |
| Type | `DeepSeek` |
| Base URL | `https://api.deepseek.com` |
| API Key | Your key from the [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) |
| Enabled | On |

3. Keep the default priority and weight unless you are configuring routing with multiple channels, then choose **Save**.

The channel type list only shows adapters registered by the running Veloce configuration. If `DeepSeek` is missing, enable the corresponding adapter in `yumeri.json` and restart the service. The Base URL may be entered as the host or with `/v1`; Veloce avoids adding a duplicate `/v1` segment when constructing requests.

#### 3. Add DeepSeek models

Click the model-list action for the new channel to open **Model configs**. There are two ways to add models:

**Sync from the API (recommended)**

1. Leave **Sync format** set to `OpenAI /v1/models`.
2. Click **Sync models**.
3. In the preview, keep the required models selected and click **Submit sync**.

Use current DeepSeek model names such as `deepseek-v4-pro` or `deepseek-v4-flash`. DeepSeek V4 models support up to 1 million tokens of context; the Veloce model dialog does not expose a context-window field, so the selected model name and the downstream client or adapter determine the effective request limits. For supported clients, use the equivalent maximum reasoning setting when configuring the client.

**Add a model manually**

1. Click **Add model config**.
2. Enter the public model name, for example `deepseek-v4-pro`.
3. Leave **Upstream model name** empty when it is the same, or enter the provider's exact upstream name.
4. Leave **Provider** on **Auto detect**. Veloce recognizes names containing `deepseek`; you can choose a provider explicitly or use **Custom provider** when needed.
5. Keep **Enabled** on and click **Save**.

#### 4. Run a first request

After the model is synced or saved, it becomes available to the assistant. Open Veloce Lab's chat, select the newly enabled DeepSeek model, and send a small coding prompt. Confirm that the response arrives and that the channel's request and token counters increase in the administration console.

#### Troubleshooting model sync

- **The server cannot fetch `/v1/models`:** Veloce opens a fallback dialog with the request URL. Choose **Fetch in browser** to retry from the browser, optionally including the channel token, or paste the model-list JSON into **Manual JSON** and choose **Parse JSON**.
- **No models appear:** verify the Base URL, API Key, adapter type, and that the upstream returns a model list from `/v1/models`. You can also choose `Generic /models`, `Generic /api/models`, or `Custom path` when the provider uses another endpoint.
- **The model is not selectable:** check that the model configuration and its upstream channel are both enabled, then refresh the model catalog.
